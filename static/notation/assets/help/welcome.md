Thanks for trying /Fun Notation/, it's a highly experimental musical notation system, at the top of this page, there are a bunch of topics to browse, you may also check the [Web Site](https://www.notation.fun) for more information.

We are using [Solf√®ge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solf%C3%A8ge) system for the note names, so instead of *C D E F G A B*, they are named *Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti*, or *1 2 3 4 5 6 7*, it's a relative notation, means the actual pitch of each notes are decided by key, check the notes page for note pitches in this song.

# Notes
Each note has a color associated with, which is for quick recognition. The color choice is based on [Chromesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromesthesia), check the notes page for more details.

# Chords
We use circles with slots in them to represent chords, it's quite controversial, but can help learning related theory, for all intervals and pitches information of all chords in current song, please check the chords page.

# Guitar
Many features of /Fun Notation/ are created for my needs for guitar tabs, please check [Amateur Guitar](https://www.amateurguitar.com) for tabs, tutorials and more information.
