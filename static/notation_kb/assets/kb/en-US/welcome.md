Thanks for trying /Fun Notation/, it's a highly experimental musical notation system, you may also check the [Web Site](https://www.notation.fun) for more information.

[Sound](:kb:sound) page will try to explain how string produce sound with harmonics.

[Scale](:kb:scale) page will try to explain the scale concept, with tools to show each scale's information
